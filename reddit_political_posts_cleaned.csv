"How many got Kamala wrong when she started and now just can't se anyone else running? When Biden stepped aside and said Kamala is the taking over...my literal words were oh no.

After more and more stories/perspective came out of Biden stepping aside when he did to let the Republicans trash him at the convention and then let Kamala run full steam ahead afterwards...I was like oh yes

And then just watching her campaign, talk, and actually talk like most of us think while still giving political policies and actually not taking the high road in talking about Republicans like they've done to us for so many years

Then picking waltz who is just, maybe, the best pick we could've gotten for a vp...likeable, and hardly a shroud of negativity except maybe exiting the military after giving proper notice and before his time to leave for Iraq..the nerve

"First Time Voter For the first time in my life, I was drawn out to vote. 

I have never had a political bone in my body. 

I was annoyingly indifferent about the entire American project. 

So, with a heavy heart, I found it no longer acceptable to be inactive. 

I felt compelled to vote not for anything but rather against so much.

I have watched Donald Trump flaunt his self-serving destruction of our nation's norms. Mutating good Americans into the type of people who denigrate the very essence of what it means to be an American.

He has corrupted so many fine and upstanding people. 

Folks I knew to be kind and good-hearted regurgitating some of the most vial talking points and excusing some of the most sick moral failures of the former president. 

To name a few that come to mind.

Trump had an affair 4 months after his wife gave birth. 

Trump was convicted in front of a jury of his peers that he had r*ped E. Jean Carroll according to the common definition of the word.

Trump plotted to steal the 2020 election by attempting to pressure Mike Pence under threat of violence into certifying Trump's false slate of electors. 

As the mob chanted ""hang Mike Pence,"" Trump tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done."" 

Trump believes that half the population should be considered ""the enemy within."" 

He has degraded prisoners of war, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured."" 

All of these have been either dismissed or praised by American ""Patriots."" 

His cult followers will defend all his unacceptable behavior by saying, ""It's all jokes"" or ""It's the liberal media."" 

Defenses that only further highlight how much he has melted the minds of these people.

It's clear that all these criticisms are not baseless attacks. They are part of an established pattern of behavior that has been validated time and time again by folks with wide-ranging relationships with Trump. 

From former staffers, government and military professionals, members of his cabinet, judges, family members, business partners, experts, and many others. 

Folks from each group all share the same resounding and clear message. 

It's the message that drove me to vote, and it's a message I would like to echo here.

Donald Trump is not fit to be the next president of the United States.",Democrat,first time voter first time life drawn vote never political bone body annoyingly indifferent entire american project heavy heart found longer acceptable inactive felt compelled vote anything rather much watched donald trump flaunt selfserving destruction nation norm mutating good american type people denigrate essence mean american corrupted many fine upstanding people folk knew kind goodhearted regurgitating vial talking point excusing sick moral failure former president name come mind trump affair 4 month wife gave birth trump convicted front jury peer rped e jean carroll according common definition word trump plotted steal 2020 election attempting pressure mike penny threat violence certifying trump false slate elector mob chanted hang mike penny trump tweeted mike penny didnt courage done trump belief half population considered enemy within degraded prisoner war saying like people werent captured either dismissed praised american patriot cult follower defend unacceptable behavior saying joke liberal medium defense highlight much melted mind people clear criticism baseless attack part established pattern behavior validated time time folk wideranging relationship trump former staffer government military professional member cabinet judge family member business partner expert many others folk group share resounding clear message message drove vote message would like echo donald trump fit next president united state

"Hey America, we need to talk. America, this is not gonna be easy to accept; but, as someone who *survived* an *attempted murder* at the hands of an **abusive, malignant narcissist**: *you're in an abusive relationship*  

i **understand** the constant gaslighting is exhausting. 

i **understand** it's infuriating that his enablers make excuses for him.  

i **understand** it's heartbreaking when everyone around him ignores everything they see and hear and pretend nothing happened.   

i **understand** a new set of rules seems to be invented just for him, and him *only*.

i **understand** its triggering to keep being told you're ""overreacting"".

i **understand** how it feels to be told that *you're* the problem, and that *you* made him hurt you by not just letting him ""blow off steam""

i **understand** his enablers are just as terrified of him, and that's why they keep supporting him.  

i **understand** when the courts keep giving him another chance to come back and finish the job.  

i **understand** the constant feelings of impending doom everytime he's present

i **understand** feeling isolated and questioning yourself and wondering if everyone else is right when they say you're just ""being too sensitive"" and reduces everything he does into a ""joke"" that you ""misunderstood"" 

i **understand** never being able to hide from or avoid him.   

i **understand** losing friends and family because he keeps lying to them and you can't change their minds, even when you show them the receipts. 

i **understand** because i *survived* it.  

But America, all is **not lost** and you are **not** crazy. Everything you feel is valid. Everything you have experienced **really did happen to you**. you **will** come out of this stronger, happier and better. 

I know that seems impossible to even imagine right now. i know you feel lost and defeated, but i promise you are not alone. i know it's terrifying to think about and predict his reaction based on all the times you tried to get out of this relationship, but *you have to cut all ties with him*. you have to get him out of your house. you have to pile all his crap on the curb. you have to change the locks. you have to block all contact and refuse to listen to anyone who advocates for him. but, you **can** escape him.     

America, you **have to vote** and you **have to vote for Joe Biden**. that's the *only* way you **survive** this abusive relationship. **you're not a victim America, you're a survivor** never forget that.  

With love and compassion,

"No, 20 million Democrats did not just “not show up.” I have been seeing this very misguided idea floating around this sub, so I’ve decided to put it to rest by calculating the remaining vote and seeing how we can expect it to add up. I’m only calculating the substantial remaining vote, meaning I’m not doing it for states that are 99% reported, as that would take forever. I’ll cluster those together in a lazy calculation at the end.

California — 7,520,900 votes to be counted.

Assuming current splits hold up (though these votes may be more heavily in Harris’s favor):

Harris — 4,332,038 Votes
Trump - 2,985,796 Votes

Oregon — 257,107 votes to be counted

Harris — 257,107 votes
Trump — 197,631 votes

Washington — 509,070 votes to be counted

Harris — 297,296 votes
Trump — 198,028 votes

Maryland — 550,074 votes to be counted

Harris — 333,894 votes
Trump — 201,877 votes

Arizona — 825,835 votes to be counted

Harris — 384,839 votes
Trump — 433,563 votes

Nevada — 134,357 votes to be counted

Harris — 63,416 votes
Trump — 68,522 votes

Now we will assume that every other state is collectively 99.5% reported, meaning ~715,567 votes remain. Since this is between both red and blue states, I’ll just assume a 50/50 split on these votes.

This means **10,512,910** votes have yet to be reported.

This brings the final expected popular vote total to:

Harris — 75,054,105 
Trump — 77,813,469 

Overall: 152,867,574 votes

Compare to 2020:

Biden: 81,283,501
Trump: 74,223,975

Overall: 155,507,476

This means that 2024 turnout will be approximately **98.3%** of 2020 turnout.

So no, it is not true that we lost because “20 million Democrats just couldn’t get off the couch.” Unfortunately, there was just an overall substantial rightward shift, which aligns with the incumbency disadvantage we’ve been seeing globally due to inflation. ",Democrat,20 million democrat “not show up” seeing misguided idea floating around sub i’ve decided put rest calculating remaining vote seeing expect add i’m calculating substantial remaining vote meaning i’m state 99 reported would take forever i’ll cluster together lazy calculation end california — 7520900 vote counted assuming current split hold though vote may heavily harris’s favor harris — 4332038 vote trump 2985796 vote oregon — 257107 vote counted harris — 257107 vote trump — 197631 vote washington — 509070 vote counted harris — 297296 vote trump — 198028 vote maryland — 550074 vote counted harris — 333894 vote trump — 201877 vote arizona — 825835 vote counted harris — 384839 vote trump — 433563 vote nevada — 134357 vote counted harris — 63416 vote trump — 68522 vote assume every state collectively 995 reported meaning 715567 vote remain since red blue state i’ll assume 5050 split vote mean 10512910 vote yet reported brings final expected popular vote total harris — 75054105 trump — 77813469 overall 152867574 vote compare 2020 biden 81283501 trump 74223975 overall 155507476 mean 2024 turnout approximately 983 2020 turnout true lost “20 million democrat couldn’t get couch” unfortunately overall substantial rightward shift aligns incumbency disadvantage we’ve seeing globally due inflation

"I’ve made more progress converting Republicans to vote for Democrats in the last 2 weeks than in the last four years. 
In the past few weeks I’ve had several conversation with Republicans I have known for years and some for just a week or two. 

These are the topics that are changing minds:
1. Mass Deportation: Even my MAGA mom doesn’t want to see her Vietnamese hairstylist or her Chinese Oncologist deported. I could make no headway with mom for almost a decade but I have finally broken through and mom brought dad with her.
2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.
3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don’t like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.

Let’s be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.

Maybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November?

I don't give a shit what people do in the bedroom. Gay marriage is legal now. Great- now they can be as miserable as I am and we've got something to talk about. But all this social policy bullshit takes the focus away on all of the important things going on: Immigration. National Security. Bringing jobs back. Being the uncontested global leader. This thought that you've got to meet some religious, evangelical metric is absurd. Watching the debates this cycle, I was halfway expecting Ted Cruz to trot out a gay person and hang them on stage just to prove how conservative he is. Stop pandering to Evangelicals for support. We don't need them. They can either join the movement or get left behind.

* Down with the Establishment. The old ways are over. If you have any doubt about that- take a look at how well Mitt Romney's hit speech went over last week. The days of grid-locking congress forever and a goddamned day because you don't want to deal with the other side, are over. Big Money PACS and lobbying groups are done. The fucking Koch Brothers reign of terror and hold on the GOP is over. This is a movement.

* We've got to heal. The rift in America is larger than we've ever seen. If we're going to become great once more, we've got to work with the other side. Look at Reagan and Tip O'Neil. They came together to get shit done.

* No more globalism. We've got to fight for our own interests both here and abroad. No more bad trade deals. No more pandering to trade groups and foreign interests. America is our number one focus moving forward.


Anyway, those are my two cents. My friends and I came here via Trump's Nationalist / Populist message and we're here to stay. The old GOP is dead.
